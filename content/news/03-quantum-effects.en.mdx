The fair and conference for quantum technologies from October 8 to 9, 2024 in Stuttgart is a must for us! In addition to a stand at the QOOOL-Camp, we will organize a QOOOL duel for students in grades 10 to 12 with our partners (Hahn-Schickard, University of Stuttgart and re:edu) as well as with other cooperation partners (including AIxpress). With the playful, creative and application-oriented approach, we want to inspire the young target group for quantum. In addition, they will learn modern methods such as design thinking approaches, business model canvas and presentation techniques. They will also be taught the basics of quantum (-sensing) and develop their own business ideas or models based on this. As is customary in duels, it is a competition, i.e. great prizes await the winning teams!
