Proudly presenting our own website for the research project QOOOL Sensing! In addition to backgrounds on quantum, you will find further information about our project partners and the goals of our project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). In our news section, you will find news about our project. We also report on our activities and keep you up to date so you don't miss any important information! In the future, you will also find updates on the planned QOOOL-Kit and the associated learning simulator here. We will also publish freely accessible teaching and learning materials on our website, so feel free to check back regularly!
