Goal of the project is to develop a [QOOOL-Kit](https://qoool-sensing.org/en/vision) as a cost-effective NV quantum magnetometer for educational purposes. At the meeting, a first prototype of the kit and its connection to the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/) as a microcontroller for collecting environmental data were discussed and tested together.

We are excited to see how things progress and will keep you updated!
