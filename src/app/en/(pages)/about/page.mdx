### re:edu

Reedu GmbH & Co. KG is a start-up from Münster and emerged from the BMBF-funded senseBox project.
senseBox project funded by the BMBF. re:edu is the manufacturer of the senseBox, a microcontroller
for collecting environmental data. The company's focus is on open sensor systems
for end consumers and the education market. The combination of open source components
open source components to create a wide range of products (software and hardware) for citizens, students and pupils,
students and pupils that enable them to participate in problem-solving processes
with social relevance (Citizen Science). The company's expertise
in the development of prototypes, driver and accompanying software for IoT products
products and effective educational solutions, particularly for the STEM sector.
In addition, re:edu has expertise in the development of educational materials and the organisation
organising events such as workshops or training courses for various groups, particularly
especially for learners and teachers.

### Institut für Mikroaufbautechnik

The Institute of Micro Packaging Technology at the Hahn-Schickard-Gesellschaft für angewandte Forschung e.V. in Stuttgart has been working in the field of microintegration of complex, three-dimensional systems with a high degree of miniaturisation for more than 20 years. Its core competences lie in technologies for spatial circuit carriers and microstructures as well as in assembly and connection technology, which is used in particular for the seamless integration of sensors in demanding environmental conditions. Hahn-Schickard is working on fundamental issues relating to the encapsulation of miniaturised quantum sensor assemblies and the simulation-based thermal management of NV-based magnetic field sensors in two research projects as part of the BMBF's QSens future cluster. In the QOOOL Sensing project, Hahn-Schickard will develop and build the quantum sensor module at the heart of the QOOOL kit, thus contributing its expertise in the field of sensor technology.

### Institut für Intelligente Sensorik und Theoretische Elektrotechnik

The Institute for Intelligent Sensors and Theoretical Electrical Engineering (IIS) is involved in the research and practical implementation of new sensor concepts. In addition to improving classical sensors, the IIS focuses on researching new, miniaturised excitation and readout concepts for various quantum sensors. After many years of experience in the miniaturisation of classical nuclear and electron spin resonance, the institute has been working for several years on CMOS-integrated microwave excitation concepts (CMOS = Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor as a technology for the construction of electronic circuits in integrated circuits) as well as (CMOS-integrated) ultra-low noise current readout circuits for solid-state quantum sensors such as NV centres and silicon sensors. e.g. NV centres and silicon defects in SiC (= silicon carbide, a chemical compound of silicon and carbon). In the area of education and training, the IIS is responsible for training in the subjects of electrodynamics and sensor and measurement technology in the electrical engineering degree programmes. The IIS also supervises the "Build your own MRI" practical course, in which students design their own MRI device.
